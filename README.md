Hello world!

Thanks for reading this! Not sure how many people will end up reading this, but thanks for stopping by! As it stands currently, my goal with GitHub and coding is to learn how to build ML, AI, and Neural Networks. It's all pretty interesting so far. I'm a little over halfway done learning Python now, we'll see where this coding adventure takes us. Thanks for reading!
